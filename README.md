# BookTabEx
## What?
A simple application to extract books from BookTab
## Why?
We all hate proprietary clients, don't we? PDFs are way easier to read on almost every device.
I believe there is no reason to install a different app to read more books.
## How?
You have 2 different methods basing on the way a book is encoded on the publisher's side. If it uses an older mode you should find it in the listview, if it does not show up then you should operate in an interactive way opening chapters one by one in the client.

If you want to understand how it works, you can read the code. It's pretty straightforward, I hope.
Yes, I know, AutoIt.
I know it's not a programming language.
I know it's not efficient.
I know it's not as powerful as many other languages, but it was easy to pick up years ago and, sadly, I never had the time or will to learn something else.
