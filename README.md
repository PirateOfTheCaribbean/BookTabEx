# BookTabEx
## What?
A simple application to extract books from BookTab(Z)
## Why?
We all hate proprietary clients, don't we? PDFs are way easier to read on almost every device.
I believe there is no reason to install different apps to read books from different publishers
## How?
You have 2 different methods basing on the way a book is encoded on the publisher's side.

- If they're are using an older mode you should find your book in the listview.
- If they're not the book will not appear and you'll have to operate in an interactive way opening chapters one by one in the BookTab(Z).

If you want to understand how it works, you can read the code. It's pretty straightforward, I hope.
## Output
- In automatic mode it'll output a large PDF with vectors instead of text, so you'll have to OCR it with Acrobat Pro (which is not good)
- In interactive mode you'll get a fully standard-compliant PDF with searchable text.

## AutoIt
Yes, I know, AutoIt.
I know it's not a programming language.
I know it's not efficient.
I know it's not as powerful as many other languages, but it was easy to pick up years ago and, sadly, I never had the time nor will to learn something else.
